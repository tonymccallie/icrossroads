					<h1>Service Times</h1>

					<p>
						We want to gather and experience God. We do that through engaging music, friendly people, times of giving and
						sharing and
						hearing relevant sermons that teach us how to practically follow the teachings of Jesus.
					</p>

					<p>
						We want you to come as you are. We dress comfortably and want to create a safe place for you to be yourself. We
						believe that
						God loves us all just the way we are and he refuses to leave us that way. He wants to make us more like Jesus.
					</p>

					<p>
						We offer donuts and coffee before our services.
					</p>

					<p>
						We'd count it our privilege to have you join us.
					</p>
