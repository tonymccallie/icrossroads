		<h3>Giving</h3>
		<p>At First Baptist, we believe that giving of our first fruits is an act of worship and a way that we can honor God with
			what He has given us. God has greatly increased the effectiveness of church through your gifts. You have an opportunity,
			as at no other time in history, to transform our world through God’s Word, one life at a time.</p>
		<p>Your tithes and gifts are vital to the everyday ministry that takes place in and through First Baptist. We ask that you
			would prayerfully consider how God is leading you to give.</p>

		<h3>It's secure</h3>
		<p>Online giving is actually more secure than checks or cash. With this system, you won’t have three or four different people
			processing your paper checks or cash. Your gift is electronically transferred directly to our bank and the information
			about your transfer is sent to our office for our internal records.
