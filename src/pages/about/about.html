		<p>Crossroads Church is committed to helping people&nbsp;<strong>CONNECT</strong>&nbsp;with God and one another, <strong>GROW</strong>&nbsp;to
			be like Jesus, and <strong>GO</strong>, serving Him by serving others.</p>
		<h3>Connect</h3>
		<p>At Crossroads we are committed to come together as a church family at our weekend services to worship God through contemporary
			music and to learn how to apply God’s Word, the Bible, in practical ways. It’s a great opportunity to introduce your friends
			and family to Jesus Christ as well. Matthew 22:37-39 “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. ”This
			is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</p>
		<h3>Grow</h3>
		<p>Crossroads’ discipleship path is to simply: Connect with God and others, Grow to be like Jesus, and Go and serve. We enact
			this growth by attending Sunday services, participating in small groups, serving in ministry, and our spending personal
			time with God, reading His Word and in prayer. John 17:17 “Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is
			truth.”</p>
		<h3>Go</h3>
		<p>At Crossroads we serve with a purpose. We do this by reaching out to the needs in our church, community, and world. We
			strive to GO into all the world. Matthew 28:19, 20 “…therefore, go and make disciples of all the nation.”</p>
