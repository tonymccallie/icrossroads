		<h2>We are a church that believes the Bible. &nbsp;</h2>
		<p>
			We believe:
		</p>
		<p><strong>God</strong><br>We believe there is one and only one living and true God. He exists in three persons — Father,
			Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit — but without division of nature, essence, or being. He is the Creator, Savior,
			Preserver, and Ruler of the universe. (Deuteronomy 6:4; John 1:1; John 1:14)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Authority Of Scripture</strong><br>We believe the Bible is God’s word. &nbsp;Our services and small groups are
			centered around preaching, teaching and learning from the Bible as the foundation for all that we do. (2 Timothy 3:16-17;
			2 Peter 1:20-21)
		</p>
		<p>

			<strong>Worship</strong><br>We believe we grow as we praise and worship Him passionately—as individuals, as families,
			and as a local church. (John 4:23-24)</p>
		<p>

			<strong>Prayer</strong><br>We believe it is essential to set aside specific times for private, family and corporate prayer.
			(Matthew 6:7; 1 Thessalonians 5:17)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Family</strong><br>We believe marriage is for life and between one man and one woman. Through a variety of activities
			we encourage family support and growth. We are committed to honoring the priority of family time through our ministries
			and activities. (Matthew 19:5-6; Ephesians 5:22-6:4)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Fellowship/Community</strong><br>We believe the church to be the people, not the buildings. We encourage and strive
			to develop personal, family, and staff relationships characterized by integrity, mutual accountability, mutual serving,
			mutual encouragement, and mutual honoring. (Romans 12:10; 1 John 4:7-11)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Life Transformation</strong><br>We believe that Jesus called us to “make disciples”. To that end we provide opportunities
			for every believer to develop in their walk with Christ while also developing a Christian worldview which provides the
			information and strength needed to minister to the culture we live, work and interact. (Ephesians 4:13; Colossians 1:28)</p>
		<p>

			<strong>Every Member Ministry</strong><br>We believe our members need the have opportunities to serve others, both inside
			and outside the church walls. We constantly strive to develop leaders who function effectively in their respective roles
			of service and, in turn, train and mentor other believers for ministry. (Ephesians 4:11-12)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Personal Evangelism/Missions</strong><br>We believe this generation of Christians is called to share their faith
			with people who need Jesus, here in Wichita Falls, the United States and around the world. &nbsp;We endeavor to share
			the message of salvation with all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, or economic status. (Matthew 28:19-20; 2 Corinthians
			5:18-20)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Stewardship</strong><br>We believe every member should live a life of giving that recognizes God’s ownership of
			everything. &nbsp;We encourage all of us to practice the biblical principle of tithing (giving at least one-tenth of one’s
			income) to support the ministries of the church. (1 Corinthians 4:2; 1 Peter 4:10)</p>
